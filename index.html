            <h1>In this seminar, students will read and present a paper on moral judgment as studied empirically in economics.</h1>
            <h2>Assignments</h2>
            <h2>Each student should present at least once (if many students register), but preferably several times, so as to have sufficient time to understand their paper in depth and to incorporate (teacher and peer) feedback in their presentation.</h2>
