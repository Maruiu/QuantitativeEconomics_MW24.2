            <h2>Quantitative Economics MW24.2</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                This course introduces students to experimental methods in economics, focusing on how controlled 
                experiments can be used to test economic theories and inform policy decisions. The course begins with an introduction 
                to the role of experiments in economics, discussing their historical development and comparison with other empirical methods. 
                It then covers the principles of designing and conducting experiments, compares lab and field experiments, and discusses
                principles of reliable and ethical research.
                Next, the course delves into key experimental topics, including individual decision-making under risk and uncertainty, 
                bargaining and coordination games, public goods and cooperation dilemmas, and market experiments. If time permits, we will 
                cover how biophysical measurements can complement experimental data. 
                The last two lectures will be reserved for going through a mock exam and a Q & A session.

            <h3>Course requirements and grading</h3>
            <p>
                Participants should have a solid background and interest in empirical work and statistics, with (at least) basic knowledge of the 
                linear regression model (OLS) and basic notions of game theory. Grading will be based on:
            </p> 
                 <ul>
                  <li>presentation of an experimental paper (20% of the final grade)</li>
                  <li>constructive comments in class, such as feedback to colleagues' presentations (10% of the final grade)</li>
                  <li>final exam on July 18, 2025 (70% of the final grade) </li>
                </ul>
            <p>    
            To pass, you have to participate actively and constructively in at least 70% sessions. If you miss a session due to health reasons, send 
            me a certificate from your GP within three days.
            </p>
