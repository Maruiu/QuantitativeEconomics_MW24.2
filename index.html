            <h1>Experimental Economics</h1>
            <p>
                This course introduces students to experimental methods in economics, focusing on how controlled 
                experiments can be used to test economic theories and inform policy decisions. The course begins with an introduction 
                to the role of experiments in economics, discussing their historical development and comparison with other empirical methods. 
                It then covers the principles of designing and conducting experiments, emphasizing key concepts such as internal and external validity, 
                incentive structures, and behavioral biases. Students will engage with foundational and contemporary research in experimental 
                economics to understand how laboratory and field experiments contribute to economic knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second part of the course delves into key experimental topics, including individual decision-making under risk and uncertainty, 
                bargaining and coordination games, public goods and cooperation dilemmas, and market experiments. Students will examine seminal 
                studies on judgment biases, social preferences, and strategic interactions. A special focus is given to auctions and market behavior, 
                where experimental methods have provided crucial insights into economic mechanisms such as bidding strategies and price formation. 
                The course also introduces recent advances in behavioral economics, including the intersection of psychology and economics in shaping 
                human decision-making.
